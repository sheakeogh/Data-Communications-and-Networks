Assignment 1

Develop a simple server application which responds to a client connection request. The server should accept a connection from a client application and send back the message  “Hello” followed by client IP address client port number as a string over the newly set up connection. Run the server in a terminal window. Open a new terminal window and connect to the server via Telnet using the following command:
    
    # telnet localhost 1234

Note:
telnet is a generic client application which can be used to connect to a server and interact with it. As in this exercise the client and the server are in the same machine,  "localhost" is used as hostname.
