There were two primary objectives for this assignment. 

The first goal was to create a server application which would read the stock information from a text file, and when the client asks for a product the server would print the information out regarding this product. 

The second aim for this assignment was to extend on from the server application. The client would not only be able to get information about a product but now also be able to buy, restock, change the price of a product, as well as add a new product to the stock. The text file containing the stock would have to update accordingly.
