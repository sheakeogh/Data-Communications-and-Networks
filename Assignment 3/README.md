Assignment 3

You are now asked to write a client application as well as a server application to provide greater stock management functionality.

Users will access the application via a client application. Users are either customers or vendors.

Based on the type of user, the system will provide different functionality.

Operations available to vendors:

Customers will be able to\
  Access information about the items (price and quantity)\
  Buy an item (change quantity).\
Vendors will be able to\
  Access information about the items (price and quantity)\
  Restock (add quantity)\
  Reprice (change price)\
  Keep a record of customer purchases.
  
Cookies should be used to allow the system to distinguish between customers and vendors and allow the vendor to store information about the client.
